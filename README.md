# Stopwatch

A simple stopwatch implementation, written entirely in Go.

## Description

The library you never knew you didn't need, Stopwatch is exactly what it says on
the tin; a simple, no-nonsense[^*] implementation of the time piece that every
self-respecting PE teacher wears proudly upon their person.

Featuring methods such as `Start()`, `Stop()`, and much _much_ more â€” nothing is
left to the imagination, and everything is possible.

## Installation

Any open source library worth its salt will condescend to remind you how to
install a package whether you like it or not.

Stopwatch makes no apologies in this regard, and includes its full, unabridged
installation instructions below.

```sh
# Copy, paste, and press the return key once
go get github.com/iainjreid/go-stopwatch
```

[^*]: This is entirely nonsense.
